# HIT137 – Assignment 2

## Overview

This repository contains the complete implementation of **Assignment 2 for HIT137**, which assesses core programming skills in file handling, data analysis, and recursive graphics using Python. The assignment is divided into three independent questions, each targeting a different learning objective.

## Question 1: Text Encryption and Decryption

This component implements a character-based encryption and decryption system for text files. The program reads an input file (`raw_text.txt`), encrypts its contents using user-defined shift values and alphabet-specific rules, and writes the result to `encrypted_text.txt`. The encrypted output is then decrypted using the reverse logic and saved as `decrypted_text.txt`. A verification step confirms whether the decrypted output matches the original input file.

This section demonstrates file input/output operations, string manipulation, and reversible algorithm design.

## Question 2: Temperature Data Analysis

This component analyses multi-year Australian temperature data collected from multiple weather stations. The program processes all provided CSV files, ignores missing values, and performs the following tasks:

- Calculates average temperatures for each season
- Identifies the station(s) with the largest temperature range
- Determines the most stable and most variable stations using standard deviation

The results are written to separate output text files as specified in the assignment requirements. This section demonstrates data aggregation, statistical computation, and structured reporting.

## Question 3: Recursive Turtle Graphics

This component generates a recursive geometric pattern using Python Turtle graphics. Starting from a regular polygon, each edge is recursively modified to create an inward indentation pattern. User inputs control the number of polygon sides, side length, and recursion depth.

This section demonstrates recursion, geometric reasoning, and graphical programming concepts.

Disclaimer:
This work was completed by the group members independently. AI tools were used only for clarification, complexity reduction, and solution verification. All final code and logic were written, reviewed, and understood by the group.
